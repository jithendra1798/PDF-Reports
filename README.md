# Instructions
***
*This document gives complete instructions to run the exe file and Python files.*
*(I am giving these instructions for the sake of clarity, even though the instructions are trivial).*
***
## Instruction - 1 :
> There are 2 folders in the main zip folder (**PDF-Reports-main**).
* **images :** Contains all the images related to the program.
* **programs :** Contains all Python programs required and a main.exe file.
* **Dummy data.xlsx :** This is the given Excel datasheet.

## Instruction - 2 :
> Some points on **programs** folder
* **main.exe :** This file is in programs folder. It is executable. If you run this program, it will give output - a folder named **Reports** inside the **PDF-Reports-main** folder. Now the PDF-Reports-main folder contains 3 folders, with the new folder **Reports** inside it.
* >**Note :** This file produces correct output when only in the **programs** folder. Because the path to **Dummy data.xlsx** is with this  folder.
* **Reports :** This folder contains all the report cards of all students. This is the output folder which contains all the student's PDF's after execution of programs.
* **main.py :** This is the main executable python file. If you run this file, it will also the same folder named **Reports** inside the **PDF-Reports-main** folder.
* >**Note :** I am clearing \__pycache__ folder for the sake of preserving the programs folder to be same.
